Yeah, they're talking back, oh'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
But they don't know what I know
Yeah, I've gone mad
They say I've gone mad
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
Oh-oh
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me tooOr am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
